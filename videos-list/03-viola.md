Title:  [Keynote] Inferring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 --- and measures to mitigate it

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHkSlePV5Q

Event description:
With the second waves of COVID-19 unfolding in most European countries, it is worth to look back at the first wave and especially the past summer, where case numbers were case numbers stayed low. I will present approaches to infer the effectiveness of interventions, and models to explore their potential. This talk will be interesting for anyone wanting to understand the current and potential future dynamics of COVID-19.

12:19 Effective growth rate
13:18 Conclusion from the first COVID wave
15:46 Date of reporting vs date of putative symptom onset
17:41 A study on the effectiveness of interventions
18:37 Effectiveness of each intervention
20:33 School vs university closure
21:31 Part 2: Controlled dynamics due to test-trace-isolate (TTI)
22:32 TTI contributes to containing the spread
23:32 3 testing strategies: random, symptom-driven, testing of contacts
24:12 Limitations of TTI
26:02 TTI contributes almost 50% of the mitigation
29:22 Capacity limit of TTI
30:12 Part 3: TTI capacity presents a tipping point
31:35 Factors that destabilize TTI
33:35 The TTI tipping point
35:00 Reported cases vs deaths - not a testing bias
37:58 What about the future?
38:14 1. Early intervention reduces case numbers
39:57 2. Lock-down allows stabilizing the situation again
40:54 3. Break the chain early
41:37 4. The coming months
45:12 Summary
46:12 Next-time: Infogenesis - Neural network self-organization for information processing
46:53 Thank you!

Speaker bio:
Viola heads a research team at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. She investigates the self-organization of spreading dynamics in the brain to understand the emergence of living computation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, she adapted these mathematical approaches to infer and predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate mitigation strategies. Viola is board member of the Campus Institute for Data Science and Fellow of the Schiemann Kolleg.
